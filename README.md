This is a repository of the projects I completed as a part of CMSC15400. These projects were completed Spring of 2022 and were all done in C

## P1: Bit Manipulation
Here we were given little "puzzles" to solve using bit manipulation - pretty straight forward. This project was very interesting and enjoyable as I had never worked with shifting bits to this degree before.
